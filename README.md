Development of a classification model for hit outcome. The development of this model was tracked in the following blog posts:

[Part 1](http://tylerjamesburch.com/blog/baseball/hit-classifier-1): Model Selection. Follows the code in ```notebooks/1-model-selection.ipynb```.

[Part 2](http://tylerjamesburch.com/blog/baseball/hit-classifier-2): Optimization. Follows the code in ```notebooks/2-added-variables.ipynb```.

[Part 3](http://tylerjamesburch.com/blog/baseball/hit-classifier-3): Re-sampling Methods. Follows the code in ```notebooks/3-resample.ipynb```.

[Part 4](http://tylerjamesburch.com/blog/baseball/hit-classifier-4): Application and Reflection. Data generation in this post uses ```python/woba_data_generate.py```. The code for visualization is in ```notebooks/4-application.ipynb```.

The final model is at ```models/final_model```.
